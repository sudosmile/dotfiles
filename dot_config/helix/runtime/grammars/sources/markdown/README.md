# tree-sitter-markdown
A markdown parser for tree-sitter

For now this implements the [CommonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/). Maybe it will be extended to support [Github flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

## Progress

All elements from the CommonMark Spec are implemented. Now fixing remaing failing test cases.
