Note: In the tree-sitter library, these examples all produce parse errors, since
we validate a query against a particular language's grammar.  These queries
refer to rules that don't exist in the JavaScript grammar.  Here, we're only
checking that they're syntactically valid queries (which they are), so these are
all _successful_ test cases.
